# Project Report: Deploying a Pre-Trained Model on Azure

### Task Definition: 

The objective of this prototype is to create a sentiment analysis tool that is able to classify social media comments, from sites such as Reddit, with the sentiment defined by the comment score being either positive or negative. An appropriate dataset for this fine-tuning task will include a corpus of comments and their associated scores. This tool can be applied for a wide variety of usages, such as assessing sentiment towards a brand or testing that generated comments will be received positively. 

### Dataset Insights: 

The dataset used for this task consists of a large collection of Reddit comments across different communities, paired with their respective vote scores. These scores range from positive to negative, indicating user sentiment towards the comment. Pre-processing steps included cleaning the data by removing any non-text elements such as URLs, special characters, and irrelevant information such as comments from bots. Vote scores were converted to label comments as either positive (above 0) or negative, as appropriate for a binary classification task. Other standard pre-processing steps such as splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets were performed before uploading the dataset.

### Model Training Summary: 

The model selected for fine-tuning is a standard pre-trained transformer-based BERT model (bert-base-uncased) from Azure's catalog. Initially, the pre-trained model was loaded with its default weights, which were trained on a large corpus of text data. The fine-tuning process involved training the model on the prepared dataset of Reddit comments, with the goal of adapting it to classify comments based on sentiment. The model was trained using a supervised learning approach, where the inputs (comments) were paired with their corresponding labels (positive or negative sentiment based on the vote score). The learning rate was optimized to avoid overfitting, and a validation set was used to monitor the modelâ€™s performance during training. Hyperparameters such as batch size, epochs, and dropout rates were tuned based on the results from the validation phase. The model was trained until it demonstrated an acceptable level of accuracy.

### Evaluation Results and Deployment:

Once the model was trained, its performance was evaluated using several key metrics to ensure it met the required standards for sentiment analysis. The primary evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy was used to measure the overall correctness of the model's predictions, while precision, recall, and F1 score provided a more detailed understanding of the model's performance. The prototype was developed using Azure and tested via implementation in a simple application developed using Azure Prompt Flow, with the model being incorporated as the model node of the sentiment classifier.

### Future Improvements:

Future work would involving incorporating more sophisticated techniques for handling context within comments. For example, current sentiment analysis models often struggle with understanding sarcasm, irony, or other context-dependent sentiment. Such improvement could come from expanding the range of sentiment labels. Instead of just positive or negative, additional categories such as neutral or mixed could be incorporated, although this would be require a more sophisticated mechanism for labeling comments when processing the dataset. The simple user interface for interacting with the tool could also be enhanced to provide more insightful analytics, such as sentiment trends over time or within a community.
