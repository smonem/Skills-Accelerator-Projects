# Project Report: LLM Application with Prompt Flow

### Task Definition

The objective of this project is to design and implement a prototype healthcare chatbot using Azure’s prompt flow tools. The chatbot aims to provide general health-related information, assist users with common medical queries, and guide them towards professional medical advice when necessary. The primary goal is to enhance ease of access to reliable health information.

### Prompt Flow Design

The prototype utilizes a standard prompt flow structure. The *input node* captures user queries and passes it to the *model node*, which leverages an LLM fine-tuned on medical literature to generate a reasonable and helpful response to the question. The *output node* provides the information in a structured format with step-by-step instructions where appropriate.

### Prototype Summary

The development process began with defining the use case and identifying common health-related queries that could be reasonably answered by a chatbot. Next steps involving finding a model appropriate for medical queries and building a simple prompt flow using Azure's tools. Testing and iteration with various prompts were then necessary to ensure that chatbot responses were accurate, relevant, and within appropriate boundaries (directs to a medical professional when necessary). Finally, the prototype was deployed and tested within an Azure environment.

### Monitoring Insights

Key metrics that I would use to measure the application's performance would include accuracy and user satisfaction. Accuracy would include benchmarking the chatbot's responses against real-world medical queries, while user feedback would be collected over time via various methods such as surveys to measure the application's usefulness.

### Future Improvements

If I were to expand this prototype for future use, I would focus on further fine-tuning to enhance the chatbot’s ability to handle a broader range of medical queries, and incorporate more aspects of reinforcement learning to refine responses over time. Another extension would be incorporating a mechanism to cross-validation the chatbot's responses with genuine medical information to ensure its accuracy in real-time.
