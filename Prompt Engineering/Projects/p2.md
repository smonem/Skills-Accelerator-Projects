The game’s dynamic progression system ensures that no two runs are the same, with randomly generated weapons, skills, and challenges that force you to rethink your approach every time you die. The deeper you venture, the more you uncover about a forgotten civilization, unraveling mysteries that will change the course of the universe. Inspired by the tactical depth of FTL, the fast-paced combat of Dead Cells, and the rich narrative of The Expanse, Stellar Descent delivers an immersive experience that keeps you coming back for more. The game expertly blends visceral action with cerebral strategy, offering endless replayability as you adapt to ever-changing threats. With its stunning sci-fi visuals, intense combat encounters, and deep lore waiting to be uncovered, Stellar Descent challenges you to push past the limits of survival, uncover the truth behind the ship’s descent, and fight for the future of a galaxy on the brink of collapse.

**Comparison**: Adding more context or a role greatly enhances the output compared to the basic prompt. While the refined prompt and role-based's output is similar, the designed role helped shaped the output's tone to be more professional and journalistic.

### Part 2: Debugging Prompt Failures

**Prompt**: Explain the concept of evolution and include jokes

*Output*:

> Evolution is the process by which species of organisms change over time through variations in traits that are passed down through generations. These changes occur due to natural selection, genetic mutations, genetic drift, and gene flow. Over long periods, these small changes can accumulate and result in entirely new species. In simple terms, evolution is how living things adapt to their environment and evolve to be better suited to it, often leading to a diverse range of species. The concept is often tied to Charles Darwin, who proposed the theory of natural selection, suggesting that organisms with traits that help them survive in their environment are more likely to pass on those traits to their offspring.
> And now, here are some evolution-themed jokes to lighten things up:
 **Why did the fish blush?** Because it saw the ocean’s bottom… and thought it was a new species! **What do you call it when a jellyfish starts a fight?** A *sting operation*. Evolution may be a serious process, but who says we can't have a little fun with it?

 *Analysis*: While the prompt explains the concepts, it fails to tie the humor directly into the explanation, and the jokes seem tangential or unrelated to the concept.

 **Refined Prompt**: Explain the concept of evolution in a brief and humorous way, including funny analogie

 *Output*: 
 > Evolution is like nature's version of a never-ending "upgrade" process for living things. Imagine if your phone kept getting new features, but instead of software updates, it's all about trial and error — and sometimes, the phone ends up with a super-long tail or a giraffe's neck. It’s like a giant game of survival hide-and-seek, where the winner gets to pass on their winning traits to the next generation. So, if you’re ever feeling lucky to have opposable thumbs, thank your ancient ancestors who didn’t fall off the tree!

 *Analysis*: This refined prompt, including more clear instructions, led to a much more casual output that directly included the humor and made it relevant to the explanation.

 ### Part 3: Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness

*Comparison*: The refined prompt, through a few simple tweaks, has produced an output that is much more warm, friendly, and excited in its tone.

### Part 4: Creative Application

*Task:* Describe tips on how to paint a minature

*Prompt*: Write a concise 2-paragraph guide covering painting a minature

*Output*: 

> Painting a miniature begins with proper preparation. Start by cleaning the model to remove any mold lines or excess flash using a fine hobby knife or file. Then, prime the miniature with a spray primer or brush-on primer to ensure the paint adheres properly. Use a light coat to avoid obscuring fine details. Once primed, apply base coats in thin layers, using the correct color for each area. This stage lays the foundation for the rest of the paintwork and ensures uniform coverage. After base coating, add shading and highlighting to bring out details. Use washes (thin, darker paints) to accentuate recessed areas, and apply highlights with lighter shades to raised areas to create depth. You can achieve smoother transitions by blending between base coats, washes, and highlights. Finish the miniature by painting finer details such as eyes, weapons, or clothing accents with a fine brush. Seal the model with a protective varnish to preserve the paint job. Patience is key, so work in layers and let each stage dry thoroughly for the best results.

*Analyis*: While the output produced is relevant, it is quite basic and generic, not covering the "how" of advanced techniques such as layering, This prompt can be refined to focus on those more and to flow better in its instructions.

*Prompt with role-based guidance*: As a professional painter, write a concise 2-paragraph guide covering advanced aspects of painting a tabletop minature. Your audience is already familar with the basics of minature painting.

*Output*: 

> When painting advanced tabletop miniatures, mastering layering and glazing techniques is essential to achieve depth and realism. Start by building smooth, gradual layers of paint, ensuring each layer is thin and well-blended to avoid visible brushstrokes. Use glazes to enhance the transitions between light and shadow, subtly adjusting the tonal values while preserving the base color underneath. For intricate details like highlights and edges, utilize a fine brush and employ the "wet-on-wet" technique to blend the edges seamlessly, or "wet-on-dry" for sharper, more defined lines. To take your miniatures further, focus on weathering and surface effects, such as rust, dirt, and wear. Dry brushing can add texture to larger surfaces, while adding pigments or pastels can simulate grime or corrosion for an authentic, battle-worn look. Additionally, consider integrating reflective and metallic paints for armor and weapons, layering them with washes to emphasize contours and details. Finally, a varnish or matte finish can help seal and protect the paintwork while adding a consistent, professional texture to the mini.
