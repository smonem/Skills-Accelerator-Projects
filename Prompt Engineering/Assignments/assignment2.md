# Assignment 2: Applying Concepts from Lessons

### Part 1. Techniques in Prompt Optimization

**Application Task:**

1. Basic Prompt:

    Generate a product description for a smartphone.

2. Refined Prompt:

    You are an advertiser tasked with creating a detailed and engaging product description for a new smartphone. Your goal is to highlight the phone's key features, including its design, performance, camera quality, and any unique selling points. Make sure to appeal to tech-savvy consumers, while keeping the language accessible for a general audience. The tone should be professional yet enthusiastic.

    Example Description: "iPhone 16 is built for Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that helps you write, express yourself, and get things done effortlessly. With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data — not even Apple."

**Reflection**

As a learner, prompt optimization can significantly streamline AI-assisted brainstorming and ideation tasks for me. By refining the prompts I use, I can guide the AI to generate more targeted and relevant ideas. For example, instead of asking a vague question like “What are some project ideas I could code?” I could specify “What are creative project ideas that I could apply machine learning to in a field such as sustainability?” This focused prompt would lead to more refined, actionable responses, saving me time and energy in sifting through irrelevant suggestions. Additionally, prompt optimization allows me to narrow down the type of output I want, such as requesting solutions for specific problems or asking for ideas tailored to certain constraints. This improves the quality and speed of the ideation process, enabling me to brainstorm more effectively and develop stronger concepts for my assignments or projects. Ultimately, optimized prompts make AI a much more effective tool in my work.

### Part 2: Debugging Prompt Failures

**Application Task:**

*Prompt*: Write a short story about life

*Output*: 

"Life, as it often is, unfolded like a tangled thread—unexpected, messy, and beautiful in ways that were only clear with time.

Ella had always seen life as a series of neat lines. She planned every step, calculated each move, and felt comfortable within the boundaries she set for herself. But life, she learned, didn’t always follow the rules.  

One autumn afternoon, as golden leaves tumbled from the trees, Ella sat on a park bench, watching people pass by. The world around her was so full of motion, so full of unexpected encounters, and yet she felt stuck in her own routine.

A stranger sat beside her, an older man with laugh lines that told stories Ella couldn't quite understand. He looked at her with a gentle smile, and after a moment of silence, he spoke.

“Life,” he said, “is like a river. It bends, it changes direction, and sometimes it flows so fast you can't keep up. But the trick is to stop fighting it and learn how to float.”

Ella blinked, surprised by his words. She didn’t have an answer, but something in her shifted. She didn’t have to be in control all the time. Life didn’t need to be neat and organized.

As the sun dipped behind the horizon, Ella smiled softly, allowing herself to let go, even if just for a moment. She realized, then, that life wasn’t something to be figured out. It was something to live—chaotic, beautiful, and always changing."

*Issues*:

1. Lacking imagery and context
2. Cliché dialogue

*Refined Prompt*:

Write a short, yet naturalistic and descriptive story featuring a person undergoing a major life transition. Avoid using generic metaphors, platitudes, or hokey life lessions.

*New Output*:

"Lena sat in her car, the engine idling, staring at the building ahead of her. The office building. Her office building. It had always been hers—she’d put in the hours, made the calls, climbed the ladder. The cold glass and steel were as familiar as her own reflection. But today, it felt like something different, something unfamiliar, as if the whole structure was holding its breath. 

She reached for her phone, scrolling through emails she had no interest in reading. They were all urgent—so many things that needed her attention, things that had always demanded it. The same things that had kept her up late, that had her checking her inbox during dinners, during weekends, during vacations. It had been years since she'd felt any real separation between work and life, since her mind was fully present in a conversation or a moment. Her work was her life, and now it felt like a weight, like a cloak that had become too tight.

Her fingers hovered over the screen. She should go in. She should sit through the meeting. She should act like everything was fine. But something in her, something she couldn’t explain, told her to stay still.

She glanced at the clock on her dashboard—9:12 AM. Her phone buzzed again. Another message from her boss. "Important," it said, followed by a list of tasks that felt more like noise than direction. 

Lena sighed, leaning back in her seat, and looked out the windshield at the city skyline. The familiar skyline. The one she’d seen from every window in the office, from every coffee shop on the way in. She’d made a life here, she’d built something. But now, in this moment, everything felt meaningless, like she was watching someone else’s story unfold.

A knock on the window broke her thoughts. Lena turned to see a young man, a delivery driver, holding a package. She rolled down the window, half-smiling as she reached for the envelope, surprised at how small and insignificant it felt in her hand. "Thank you," she said, her voice flat.

The man smiled, but it was one of those polite, distant smiles, the kind people give when they don’t expect anything in return. As he turned to leave, he paused, looking back at her for a second longer than necessary. 

“You alright?” he asked, his voice gentle.

Lena blinked, taken off guard. It wasn’t a question people asked her anymore. Not really. People had stopped asking her a long time ago, assuming she was always fine, always moving, always busy. The young man seemed to sense that she hadn’t heard it in a while.

“I’m fine,” she said, though it felt like a lie, a thin one that barely held together. “Just—” She hesitated. She didn’t know what to say. “Just thinking.”

“Alright,” he said, nodding, before walking away without another word.

Lena watched him leave, feeling a quiet pang. A strange feeling settled over her. The kind of feeling you get when you realize you’ve been looking at the wrong thing all along. She had been so busy focusing on the structure of her life—on what was expected, on what needed to be done—that she hadn’t paused to wonder if it was what she wanted. 

The car was still. The phone was still buzzing. The world was still moving.

She sat there, and for the first time in a long while, didn’t feel the need to move with it."

**Case Study Activity**:

*Issues*:
1. Vague concept
2. Target audience not specified
3. Unclear expectations

*Revised Prompt*:

"Imagine you are a high school science teacher. Choose one major scientific concept (e.g., photosynthesis, gravity, or the laws of motion) and provide a detailed yet accessible explanation.

**Reflection**:

A real-world situation that could be affected by poorly crafted prompts is customer service. Without the right guidance and context, the AI or chatbot may not be able to fulfill its role effectively or provide accurate help. Resolving this would mean applying the usual solutions, such as providing a specific role, context, and output expections to the chatbot in the prompt.

### Part 3: Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness

The AI output is concise and to the point, yet lacks sincerity in its tone. This could be provided by providing more details on the role of the writer and desired tone in the initial prompt.

**Activity:**

This prompt lacks any mention of the intended purpose or audience of the summary, along with how the summary should be formatted.

*Rewritten Prompt*:

Summarize the following document; your summary should have a professional tone, capture the key points of the document, be approximately 250 words long, avoid extraneous details, and be tailored to an audience who is familiar with the subject matter."

**Reflection:**

Evaluating prompt effectiveness has significantly boosted my productivity and minimized errors in my work with AI. When I first started using AI like ChatGPT, I often struggled with getting vague or unclear responses. By refining my prompts, I learned to provide clearer instructions and context, leading to more accurate and relevant answers. This approach has saved me time, as I no longer need to sift through irrelevant information or provide multiple clarifications. The more effective the prompt, the quicker I can move on to the next task. Additionally, fine-tuning prompts helps reduce errors, especially when I'm working on complex assignments or research. By specifying details upfront, I ensure the AI focuses on exactly what I need, preventing misinterpretations or irrelevant suggestions. In essence, prompt evaluation has helped me become more efficient in my use of AI, streamlining the process and reducing unnecessary mistakes or wasting time.
